# CONTACT-MANAGER-APP
CONTACT MANAGER APP DESIGNED BY BHARADWAJ

I used HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT for desingning this app.
Initially a new user login into the page by gIving his name, email, and password and also he conforms his password.
The hw will redirected to the contacts app 

Here he can store the new contacts by adding their name, email, password 

On clicking on the ADD CONTACT BUTTON a new user is added, then the available users list is visible on the right side of the screen.

If an existing user he or she can use login page and see their contacts

If they remove all the contacts by clocking on RESET BUTTON or then can delete individual contacts by clik on DELETE BUTTON
